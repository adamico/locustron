### 3. Space Battle ‚ùå (Currently Non-Interactive)

**Current Behavior:**
- Ships spawn randomly across large area
- Ships move with random velocity changes
- Ships avoid crowding (basic flocking)
- Ships wrap around screen edges
- No player interaction whatsoever

**Potential Interactive Additions:**

#### Option A: **Player Ship Control** (Recommended)
```lua
-- Add player ship that others react to
self.player_ship = {
   x = 256, y = 192,
   w = 8, h = 8,
   vx = 0, vy = 0,
   type = "player_ship",
   faction = "player"
}

-- Controls:
-- Arrow keys: 8-directional movement
-- X button: Fire weapon
-- O button: Boost speed
```

**Gameplay Benefits:**
- Navigate through space battle
- Ships react to player presence (some flee, some pursue)
- Capture objectives by proximity
- Visual feedback shows player influence on battle

#### Option B: **RTS-Style Objective Control**
```lua
-- Click/select objectives to influence ship behavior
-- X button: Cycle through objectives
-- O button: Send ships to selected objective
-- Ships cluster around player-selected objectives
```

#### Option C: **Camera Control Only** (Minimal)
```lua
-- Arrow keys: Pan camera view
-- X/O: Zoom in/out
-- Observe battle from different perspectives
```

**Recommendation:** **Option A (Player Ship)** - Most engaging, demonstrates spatial partitioning queries for combat

---

### 4. Dynamic Ecosystem ‚ùå (Currently Non-Interactive)

**Current Behavior:**
- Organisms spawn randomly
- Organisms use flocking/separation behavior
- Organisms age and die naturally
- No player interaction whatsoever

**Potential Interactive Additions:**

#### Option A: **Environmental Influence** (Recommended)
```lua
-- Player is an "environmental force" that organisms react to
self.cursor = {
   x = 256, y = 192,
   influence_radius = 40,
   type = "influence"
}

-- Controls:
-- Arrow keys: Move influence cursor
-- X button: Attract organisms (food source)
-- O button: Repel organisms (predator)
-- Hold buttons for sustained effect
```

**Gameplay Benefits:**
- Watch organisms flock toward cursor (attraction)
- Watch organisms flee from cursor (repulsion)
- Create patterns and test flocking behavior
- Visual feedback of spatial query radius

#### Option B: **God-Mode Spawning**
```lua
-- Controls:
-- Arrow keys: Move cursor
-- X button: Spawn organism at cursor
-- O button: Remove nearby organisms
-- Up/Down: Increase/decrease spawn rate
```

#### Option C: **Ecosystem Parameters** (Scientific)
```lua
-- Controls:
-- Up/Down: Adjust separation distance
-- Left/Right: Adjust organism speed
-- X: Increase spawn rate
-- O: Decrease spawn rate
-- See real-time effect on ecosystem behavior
```

**Recommendation:** **Option A (Environmental Influence)** - Most intuitive, demonstrates spatial queries for proximity detection

   if btn(2) then move_y = -1 end  -- Up
   if btn(3) then move_y = 1 end   -- Down
   
   -- Normalize diagonal
   if move_x ~= 0 and move_y ~= 0 then
      move_x, move_y = move_x * 0.7071, move_y * 0.7071
   end
   
   self.player_ship.x = self.player_ship.x + move_x * self.player_ship.speed * fps_time_step
   self.player_ship.y = self.player_ship.y + move_y * self.player_ship.speed * fps_time_step
   
   -- Wrap around edges
   if self.player_ship.x < 0 then self.player_ship.x = 512 end
   if self.player_ship.x > 512 then self.player_ship.x = 0 end
   if self.player_ship.y < 0 then self.player_ship.y = 384 end
   if self.player_ship.y > 384 then self.player_ship.y = 0 end
   
   self.loc:update(self.player_ship, self.player_ship.x, self.player_ship.y, 
                   self.player_ship.w, self.player_ship.h)
end

function SpaceBattle:update_ai_ships()
   -- AI ships now query for player proximity
   for _, ship in ipairs(self.objects) do
      local nearby = self.loc:query(ship.x - 60, ship.y - 60, 120, 120)
      
      if nearby[self.player_ship] then
         -- React to player presence (flee or pursue based on faction)
         local dx = self.player_ship.x - ship.x
         local dy = self.player_ship.y - ship.y
         local dist = math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)
         
         if dist > 0 then
            -- Example: flee from player
            ship.vx = ship.vx - (dx/dist) * 50 * fps_time_step
            ship.vy = ship.vy - (dy/dist) * 50 * fps_time_step
         end
      end
   end
end
```

#### Dynamic Ecosystem Scene - Add Environmental Influence
```lua
function DynamicEcosystem:enteredState()
   -- Add cursor/influence point
   self.cursor = {
      x = 256, y = 192, radius = 40,
      mode = "neutral", -- neutral, attract, repel
      type = "cursor"
   }
end

function DynamicEcosystem:update()
   self:update_cursor()  -- New method
   -- ... existing update code with cursor influence
end

function DynamicEcosystem:update_cursor()
   -- Move cursor
   local move_speed = 100
   if btn(0) then self.cursor.x = self.cursor.x - move_speed * fps_time_step end
   if btn(1) then self.cursor.x = self.cursor.x + move_speed * fps_time_step end
   if btn(2) then self.cursor.y = self.cursor.y - move_speed * fps_time_step end
   if btn(3) then self.cursor.y = self.cursor.y + move_speed * fps_time_step end
   
   -- Set influence mode
   if btn(4) then 
      self.cursor.mode = "attract"  -- X button: attract
   elseif btn(5) then
      self.cursor.mode = "repel"    -- O button: repel
   else
      self.cursor.mode = "neutral"
   end
   
   -- Keep cursor in bounds
   self.cursor.x = mid(0, self.cursor.x, 512)
   self.cursor.y = mid(0, self.cursor.y, 384)
end

function DynamicEcosystem:apply_cursor_influence(obj)
   if self.cursor.mode == "neutral" then return end
   
   -- Query for organisms near cursor
   local dx = obj.x - self.cursor.x
   local dy = obj.y - self.cursor.y
   local dist = math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)
   
   if dist < self.cursor.radius and dist > 0 then
      local force = (self.cursor.radius - dist) / self.cursor.radius
      
      if self.cursor.mode == "attract" then
         -- Pull toward cursor
         obj.vx = obj.vx - (dx/dist) * 100 * force * fps_time_step
         obj.vy = obj.vy - (dy/dist) * 100 * force * fps_time_step
      elseif self.cursor.mode == "repel" then
         -- Push away from cursor
         obj.vx = obj.vx + (dx/dist) * 150 * force * fps_time_step
         obj.vy = obj.vy + (dy/dist) * 150 * force * fps_time_step
      end
   end
end
```

### Visual Feedback

Both scenes should add visual indicators:
- **Space Battle**: Draw player ship with distinct color, show health bar
- **Dynamic Ecosystem**: Draw cursor circle, color-code by mode (green=attract, red=repel, gray=neutral)

## Conclusion

**Recommendation: Add interactivity to Space Battle and Dynamic Ecosystem scenes**

The changes are minimal (~50 lines per scene) but significantly improve the demo experience. The interactive elements:
- Demonstrate spatial partitioning concepts clearly
- Create engaging, memorable experiences
- Showcase real-world use cases (combat, flocking, proximity detection)
- Maintain consistency across all 4 demo scenes

All scenes would then use arrow keys for movement and X/O buttons for actions, creating a unified control scheme that's easy to learn and explain.
