## Quick Reference Guide

| Algorithm | Best For | Performance | Memory | Complexity | Dynamic Objects |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Fixed Grid** | Bounded worlds, uniform objects | Excellent | Medium | Low | Excellent |
| **Quadtree** | Clustered objects, adaptive needs | Good | Low | Medium | Good |
| **Hash Grid** | Large/sparse worlds | Excellent | Low | Low | Excellent |

## Algorithm Comparison

### Fixed Grid

- **Strengths**: Simple, predictable, fast updates, cache-friendly
- **Weaknesses**: Memory inefficient for sparse worlds, poor for clustered objects
- **Best For**: Platformers, bounded uniform worlds, real-time applications
- **Performance**: O(1) queries, O(1) updates, fixed memory usage

### Quadtree

- **Strengths**: Adaptive subdivision, memory efficient, good for clusters
- **Weaknesses**: Overhead for uniform objects, rebalancing cost, complex implementation
- **Best For**: Open-world games, clustered resources, varying object densities
- **Performance**: O(log n) queries, O(log n) updates, variable memory usage

### Hash Grid

- **Strengths**: Memory efficient, handles large worlds, no rebalancing, infinite worlds
- **Weaknesses**: Hash collisions possible, higher per-cell overhead, less intuitive
- **Best For**: Massive open worlds, procedural generation, highly variable densities
- **Performance**: O(1) queries, O(1) updates, sparse memory allocation

## Decision Framework

### By Object Distribution

- **Uniform distribution** → Fixed Grid (predictable, minimal overhead)
- **Clustered distribution** → Quadtree (adapts to density variations)
- **Sparse distribution** → Hash Grid (only allocates active regions)

### By World Size

- **Small (< 1K objects)** → Fixed Grid (all algorithms work well)
- **Medium (1K-5K objects)** → Fixed Grid or Quadtree (grid simpler, quadtree more adaptive)
- **Large (5K-10K objects)** → Quadtree or Hash Grid (quadtree for clustering, hash for sparsity)
- **Massive (>10K objects)** → Hash Grid (handles sparsity best)

### By Update Frequency

- **Static objects** → Any algorithm (all handle static well)
- **Low movement** → Fixed Grid (minimal update overhead)
- **Medium movement** → Quadtree (rebalancing manageable)
- **High movement** → Fixed Grid (constant time updates)

## Migration Guide

### From Fixed Grid to Quadtree

**When**: Objects are heavily clustered, memory usage too high, query performance degrading

**Steps**:

1. Change strategy configuration
2. Test with same object set
3. Adjust max_objects_per_node parameter
4. Profile performance difference

### From Quadtree to Hash Grid

**When**: World size growing significantly, many empty regions, memory efficiency critical

**Steps**:

1. Switch to hash_grid strategy
2. Choose appropriate cell size
3. Test hash function performance
4. Verify no hash collisions

## Conclusion

Choosing the right spatial partitioning algorithm is crucial for game performance. Fixed Grid
offers simplicity and predictability for bounded worlds, Quadtree adapts to object clustering,
and Hash Grid excels in large sparse environments. Consider your specific requirements and
use the benchmarks to validate your choice.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Start with Fixed Grid for simplicity
- Use Quadtree when objects cluster
- Choose Hash Grid for large worlds
- Always benchmark your specific use case
- Consider migration as requirements evolve
