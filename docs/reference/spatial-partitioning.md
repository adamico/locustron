# Spatial Partitioning Theory

## Overview

Spatial partitioning is a fundamental computer science technique for organizing objects
in space to accelerate spatial queries. Locustron implements multiple spatial
partitioning algorithms optimized for different use cases in game development.

## Core Concepts

### What is Spatial Partitioning?

Spatial partitioning divides space into regions and organizes objects based on their
spatial location. This allows for efficient queries by only checking relevant regions
instead of all objects.

### Why Spatial Partitioning Matters

**Without Spatial Partitioning:**

- Collision detection: O(n²) - check every object against every other object
- Viewport culling: O(n) - check every object against viewport
- Range queries: O(n) - scan all objects

**With Spatial Partitioning:**

- Collision detection: O(k) - check only nearby objects
- Viewport culling: O(k) - check only visible regions
- Range queries: O(k) - check only relevant partitions

Where k << n (k is much smaller than n)

## Fundamental Trade-offs

### Space vs Time

- **More partitions** = Faster queries, more memory usage
- **Fewer partitions** = Slower queries, less memory usage

### Static vs Dynamic

- **Static partitioning** = Fast queries, expensive updates
- **Dynamic partitioning** = Slower queries, fast updates

### Uniform vs Adaptive

- **Uniform partitioning** = Predictable performance, may waste space
- **Adaptive partitioning** = Efficient space usage, variable performance

## Spatial Partitioning Algorithms

### Fixed Grid (Uniform Grid)

**Structure:** Space divided into fixed-size grid cells
**Best For:** Uniform object distributions, bounded worlds
**Advantages:** Simple, predictable, fast updates
**Disadvantages:** Inefficient for clustered objects, fixed memory overhead

**Algorithm:**

```lua
-- Grid cell calculation
cell_x = math.floor(x / cell_size)
cell_y = math.floor(y / cell_size)
cell_index = cell_y * grid_width + cell_x
```

### Quadtree (Hierarchical Tree)

**Structure:** Space recursively subdivided into quadrants
**Best For:** Clustered objects, adaptive subdivision
**Advantages:** Adapts to object density, efficient for clusters
**Disadvantages:** Complex, overhead for uniform distributions

**Algorithm:**

```lua
function subdivide(node)
  if node.objects > max_objects and node.depth < max_depth then
    -- Create 4 child nodes (NW, NE, SW, SE)
    -- Redistribute objects to children
    -- Recurse on children if needed
  end
end
```

### Hash Grid (Spatial Hash)

**Structure:** Objects mapped to cells via hash function
**Best For:** Large sparse worlds, unbounded space
**Advantages:** Handles large worlds, memory efficient
**Disadvantages:** Hash collisions, less predictable performance

**Algorithm:**

```lua
function hash_position(x, y, cell_size)
  local cell_x = math.floor(x / cell_size)
  local cell_y = math.floor(y / cell_size)
  return cell_x .. "," .. cell_y  -- Simple hash key
end
```

### BSP Tree (Binary Space Partitioning)

**Structure:** Space recursively split by planes
**Best For:** Complex spatial relationships, ray casting
**Advantages:** Excellent for line-of-sight, collision detection
**Disadvantages:** Complex construction, expensive updates

### BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy)

**Structure:** Objects grouped by bounding volumes
**Best For:** Dynamic objects, ray casting, collision detection
**Advantages:** Handles moving objects well, good for physics
**Disadvantages:** Construction overhead, complex maintenance

### By Use Case

**Game Type → Recommended Algorithm:**

- **Platformer** (bounded, uniform): Fixed Grid
- **Open World RPG** (large, sparse): Hash Grid
- **Survival Game** (clustered, dynamic): Quadtree
- **Racing Game** (moving objects): BVH
- **Strategy Game** (complex queries): BSP Tree

## Implementation Considerations

### Memory Management

- **Object pooling**: Reuse table structures to reduce GC pressure
- **Sparse allocation**: Only create cells/regions when needed
- **Reference management**: Weak references for automatic cleanup

### Update Strategies

- **Immediate updates**: Update partitions immediately on object movement
- **Deferred updates**: Batch updates for better performance
- **Lazy updates**: Update only when queried

### Query Optimization

- **Broad phase**: Use spatial partitioning for candidate selection
- **Narrow phase**: Apply precise collision detection to candidates
- **Filter functions**: Reduce processing with early rejection

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Partitioning

Creating too many partitions increases memory usage and reduces performance benefits.

**Symptoms:**

- High memory usage
- Diminishing returns on query performance
- Excessive partition management overhead

**Solutions:**

- Profile partition counts
- Adjust partition size based on object density
- Use adaptive algorithms for varying densities

### Under-Partitioning

Too few partitions defeats the purpose of spatial partitioning.

**Symptoms:**

- Query performance similar to brute force
- Many objects per partition
- False positives dominate results

**Solutions:**

- Reduce partition size
- Switch to adaptive algorithms
- Profile query vs brute force performance

### Update Overhead

Frequent updates can be more expensive than queries.

**Symptoms:**

- Poor performance with moving objects
- Updates take longer than queries
- Memory fragmentation

**Solutions:**

- Batch updates when possible
- Use algorithms optimized for dynamic objects
- Implement deferred update strategies

## Advanced Topics

### Hybrid Approaches

Combine multiple algorithms for optimal performance:

- **Grid + Tree**: Grid for coarse partitioning, tree for fine-grained queries
- **Hash + Quadtree**: Hash for large worlds, quadtree for local clusters

### Parallel Processing

Spatial partitioning enables parallel query processing:

- **Thread per region**: Process different spatial regions concurrently
- **SIMD operations**: Vectorize collision checks within regions
- **GPU acceleration**: Use compute shaders for spatial queries

### Networking Considerations

For multiplayer games:

- **Region ownership**: Assign spatial regions to different servers
- **Interest management**: Send updates only for relevant regions
- **Load balancing**: Redistribute regions based on object density

## Conclusion
